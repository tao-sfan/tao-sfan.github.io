I am an Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my bachelor's degree in statistics from University of Virginia in Spring 2023. Currently, my research interest includes causal inference, sports analytics, statistical modeling and statistical machine learning. I am also open to other topics in statistics.

My CV is available [here](https://tao-sfan.github.io/files/cv_tao.pdf).
