I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my bachelor's degree in statistics from University of Virginia in Spring 2023. 

Currently, I'm working with Professor [Peter Chien](https://mendota.cdis.wisc.edu/index.html).

My CV is available [here](https://tao-sfan.github.io/files/cv_tao.pdf).
